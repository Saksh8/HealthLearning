## Context 📋

Data has been collected to monitor maternal health during pregnancy, focusing on key attributes that can indicate potential health risks. These attributes include:

- **Age**: Age of the pregnant woman in years.
- **SystolicBP**: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- **DiastolicBP**: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.
- **BS**: Blood glucose levels in terms of molar concentration (mmol/L).
- **HeartRate**: Resting heart rate in beats per minute.
- **Risk Level**: Predicted risk intensity level during pregnancy based on the aforementioned attributes.

## Educational Use 📚

This dataset is valuable for educational purposes, particularly for studying risk factors associated with maternal health during pregnancy. It provides an opportunity to analyze the relationship between various health indicators and the predicted risk level, which can aid in understanding the dynamics of maternal health care.

## Inspiration 💡

This dataset can inspire research and analysis aimed at identifying the strongest indications for health risks during pregnancy. By exploring the relationships between health conditions such as blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and heart rate, researchers can gain insights into predictive risk factors and potential interventions to improve maternal health outcomes.
