# Health Learning: ML and Deep Learning for Healthcare ü©∫üß†

Health Learning is an open-source project aimed at leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques to address various healthcare challenges. By harnessing the power of data-driven approaches, our goal is to develop predictive models, diagnostic tools, and decision support systems to improve patient outcomes, optimize healthcare delivery, and advance medical research.

## Motivation üöÄ

The field of healthcare is ripe for innovation, with vast amounts of data available from diverse sources such as electronic health records, medical imaging, wearable devices, and genetic sequencing. Health Learning seeks to harness this wealth of data to tackle a wide range of healthcare issues, including disease prediction, diagnosis, treatment optimization, and personalized medicine. By democratizing access to healthcare data and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, we aim to empower researchers, clinicians, and healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions and drive innovation in healthcare.

## Datasets üìä

Health Learning provides access to a curated collection of healthcare datasets sourced from various sources, including public repositories like Kaggle. These datasets cover a broad spectrum of health-related topics, including maternal health, diabetes classification, cardiovascular disease risk factors, stroke prediction, cancer imaging, and more. Researchers and developers can explore these datasets to develop and validate machine learning models for a wide range of healthcare applications. Individual projects have their datasets mentioned in respective README.md files.
