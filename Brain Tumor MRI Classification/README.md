## What is a Brain Tumor?

A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in the brain. These tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign), and they can cause pressure inside the skull to increase, leading to brain damage and life-threatening complications.

## Importance of the Subject üí°

Early detection and classification of brain tumors are crucial in medical imaging research, as they help in selecting the most appropriate treatment methods to save patients' lives.

## Methods üõ†Ô∏è

The application of deep learning approaches in medical imaging has provided impactful solutions for brain tumor diagnosis. This experimental work focuses on detecting brain tumors, identifying their locations, and classifying them based on malignancy, grade, and type using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models are used for multi-task classification, including tumor detection and classification. Additionally, a CNN-based model is employed for segmenting the brain tumor to identify its location.

## About the Dataset üìä

This dataset consists of 7023 images of human brain MRI images, classified into 4 classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. The images are obtained from a combination of three datasets: figshare, SARTAJ dataset, and Br35H. The "no tumor" class images are sourced from the Br35H dataset, while images from the SARTAJ dataset have been removed due to incorrect categorization of glioma class images. It's worth noting that the image sizes vary, and resizing them to the desired size after preprocessing is recommended to improve model accuracy.
